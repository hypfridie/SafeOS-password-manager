## 📱 Overview

SafeOS is a comprehensive password management solution built for Android that prioritizes security, privacy, and user experience. With its sleek iOS-inspired dark interface and robust security features, SafeOS keeps your digital credentials safe without compromising on usability.

**Why SafeOS?**
- 🔒 **Zero Trust Architecture** - Your data never leaves your device unencrypted
- 🎨 **Beautiful Interface** - iOS-inspired design with Material 3 components
- 🚀 **Performance First** - Optimized for speed and battery efficiency
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Security** - AES-256 encryption with biometric authentication

---

## ⚠️ Why SafeOS Is NOT Open Source

SafeOS Password Manager is **not open source**, and this is a deliberate decision for your security:

> **The encryption key used to protect user data is present in the app’s source code. If published openly, this would compromise the safety of every user's sensitive information, making the strongest encryption worthless.**

Open source is great for collaboration and transparency, but for security-critical apps like SafeOS, the risk of exposing cryptographic secrets is too high.  
**As the sole developer of SafeOS, I am committed to keeping your data secure, and that means keeping this project closed source.**  
All development, updates, and maintenance are handled by me alone.
